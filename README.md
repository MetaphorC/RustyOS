### RustyOS

This project is inspired by [Redox OS](https://github.com/redox-os). My plans with this project are to create a microkernel OS from scratch in Rust to target embedded systems. In future, the project is very much likely to be pushed to be a general purpose OS.

Aug 20, 2023 - Done with barebones implementation and creating a basic unit testing framework.
